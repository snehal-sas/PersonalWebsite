<p>When UW students apply to and are accepted into a major, it takes the office of univesity registrar about a week to update this information for hundreds of students. This lag time means that students have to constantly check for information updates to their profile and then rush to enroll into competitive majors classes with limited availability. <br><br>

The program belows sends a request to university servers every 10 minutes and notifies you if your major has changed, so that you have a higher likehood of getting into the classes you want.</p>
