<p>This project was a data visualization exercise to map all the major BLM protest that have happened in the United States. The end result looks like the first picture on the left. <br><br>

As seen in the second picture, every blue dot represents a protest and hovering over the data point launches a popup that details the location and some information about the protest. For example, when was the protest? how many people showed up? what was the protesting route? and, occasionally, what was the police responce like? <br><br>

Lastly, the map also allows you to zoom into each state and see some of the previous protests that have happened in your state. <br><br>

Full map on Github as map.html and data.txt can be found on kaggle.com </p>
