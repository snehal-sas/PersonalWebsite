<p>This is a Julius Caesar Q&A Chatbot. Along with being able to answer common trivia questions about Caesar, it can compensate for spelling-errors and different ways of phrasing a questions. <br><br>

Currently requires a 3.6 python interpreter to run because tensorflow does not work very well with the latest version of python. <br><br>

A demo of the chatbot can be found on <a target = "_blank" href="https://youtu.be/1YRRSRFpRUk"><u>YouTube</u> </a>. </p>
