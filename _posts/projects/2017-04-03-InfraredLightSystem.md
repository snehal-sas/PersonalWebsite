<p>I used an Arduino Uno Rev3 microcontroller to build an infrared light system that, using servos, flips a light switch on or off everytime someone trips the motion detectors. <br><br>

An additional feature of the motion detection system was that because it used modulated Infrared rays, the motion sensors could be trigerred through a TV remote and some RC car controllers. Meaning that if you angle the motion sensors just right, you could turn lights on and off from your living room. <br><br>

Material used: Arduino Uno Rev3 microcontroller, IRED, IR Detector, 2 servos, LED, 12 jumper wires, 3 x 3 cardboard cutout.</p>
